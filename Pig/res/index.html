		<p>Pig is a game played with two dice. The object of the game is to reach 100 points before your opponent.</p>
		<p>Each player take turns rolling the two dice. If no die shows a '1', the player adds the face value of the dice to their round score.</p>
		<p>If either die shows a '1', the player scores 0 for their round, and their turn ends.</p>
		<p>If both dice show '1', then the player's total score is reduced to 0, and their turn ends. </p>
		<p>After each roll, a player may choose to roll again, or 'hold'.</p>
		<p>If a player holds, their round score is added to their total score and their turn ends. </p>
		<p>The game ends when one player reaches a total of 100 points.</p>
